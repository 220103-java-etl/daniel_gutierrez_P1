## Description

ERS, or Employee Reimbursement System is a full-stack web application that allows employees to submit requests for reimbursements for courses, events, and certifications. These requests can then be approved or rejected by the Finance Manager, while the employee is able to track the status of their requests. You will be required to present a 10 minute demo of your application and its features.
